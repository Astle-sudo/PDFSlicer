# Why PDF slicer ?
Sometimes I find it difficult and often tedious to cut some PDFs into slices, hence decided to write a little application on it.

## Python
Download the pdfslice.py file, and run >python3 pdfSlice.py file.pdf command, input the start and end page numbers and click on the button.

## Javascript
It is pretty straightforward, although slicing it downloads the files as well.
