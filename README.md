# Why PDF slicer ?
Sometimes I find it difficult and often tedious to cut some PDFs into slices, hence decided to write a little application on it.

## Python
Download the pdfslice.py file, and run 
> python3 pdfSlice.py file.pdf
command in the terminal (the file and the pdf must be in the same folder), input the start and end page numbers and click on the button.

## Javascript
It is pretty straightforward, although slicing it downloads the files as well.
