# QuickStart
Sometimes I find it difficult and often tedious to slice some PDFs into smaller versions or parts, hence decided to write a little program to ease this task.

## Python
Download the pdfSlicer file, and run 
> python3 pdfSlicer.py file.pdf

command in the terminal (the file and the pdf must be in the same folder), input the start and end page numbers and click on the button.

## Javascript
It is pretty straightforward, remember: slicing it downloads the files as well.
